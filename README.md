# SyntheticData

CTGAN stands for Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network which is used for generating real looking tabular data with the help of GANs. 
This module includes my work for generating synthetic data with the help of CTGAN. Power Grid dataset (https://sites.google.com/a/uah.edu/tommy-morris-uah/ics-data-sets) is a small dataset. CTGAN is used to generate synthetic data that mimics Power Grid data and thus expand the Power Grid dataset. 

binaryAllNaturalPlusNormalVsAttacks ---> real dataset


preData ---> preprocessed dataset
